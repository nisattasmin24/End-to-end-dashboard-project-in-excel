I have completed this project by following these steps:
1) Business requirement gathering
2) Understanding of data
3) Data Connection (Imported Data using Power Query)

KPI's Requirement:
1) Count the total number of patients visiting the emergency room each day. Show a daily trend with an area sparkline to spot patterns like busy days or seasonal days.
2) Find the average time patients wait to see a medical professional. Use an area sparkline to track daily changes and highlight days with longer wait times that may  require improvements.
3) Check the average daily satisfaction score of patients to assess service quality. Use an area sparkline to show trends, spot drops in satisfaction, and link them to the challenges.

Charts Created:
1) Patient Admission Status: Showed how many patients were admitted vs. not admitted.
2) Patient Age Distribution: Grouped patients by age.
3) Timelines: Measured the percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes.
4) Gender Analysis: Display the number of patients by gender.
5) Department Referrals: Check which departments patients are referred to the most.
